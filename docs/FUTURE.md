- Lint fixing, test generation, documentation updates
- JSON output format with budget limits and timeouts
- Exit codes for pipeline integration
- Triggered by GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other CI systems

## Refactoring Mode

Semi-autonomous mode with acceptance criteria:
- Takes a refactoring plan as input

- Web terminal (ttyd) for interactive access in cloud

## Host-Side SKILL Plugin

Claude Code skill on the host machine to spawn containers:
- `/container-start` skill to launch claude-devcontainer
